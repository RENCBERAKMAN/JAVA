This repository serves as a personal notebook where I regularly record the knowledge I gain and the examples I create throughout my Java learning journey.
My goal is to retain what Iâ€™ve learned, easily access it when I need to review, and track my progress over time.

Each topic will be shared with its own explanation and example code.
I am currently at a beginner level, and new topics will be added as I continue learning.
